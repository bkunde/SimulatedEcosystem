## Overview
This project is an ecosystem simulation developed using the Unity game engine. The simulation models the interactions between rabbits and foxes in a simplified ecosystem environment. The goal is to observe and analyze the population dynamics and predator-prey relationships within the ecosystem.

## Features
- Simulation of rabbit and fox populations
- Movement and behavior of rabbits and foxes
- Predation interactions between foxes and rabbits
- Basic reproductive behavior from rabbits and foxes
- User interaction to modify environmental conditions and observe their effects on the ecosystem
